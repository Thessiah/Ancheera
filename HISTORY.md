# Last Words

I'll try to give some background to the structure of this extension as best as I can. The code is fairly hacky due to my initial lack of js knowledge, various refactors, and unfinished features, but I will do my best to help any intrepid developers get through it.

In an ideal world I would rewrite the whole thing using libraries that I've learned how to use to clean up the code. On the front end I would scrap the sass setup completely and replace it with React and in the background scripts I would use a more functional library like functional.js or immutable.js.

Please let me know if you have any questions, or if you guys manage to create a community to actually curate and hopefully clean up this pile of shit, I would love to know about it. You can best contact me through my discord Thessiah#7593.
